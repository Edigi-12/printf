C - printf

GENERAL

Our function emulates the result that should print the function printf
only with 'c' for character, 's' for string, 'd' for decimal, 'i' for
decimal (It's the same in the printf, but it's different in scanf function),
'%' for print %.

We created a man page called man_3_printf if you want more information
about the function.
